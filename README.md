__PROJECT DESCRIPTION :__ 
The main thread of this project is the study of the mathematical concept of integrator and resonator neuron through biophysical models (INa/IK type) and phenomenological models, as well as the possibility that the behavior of a neuron model changes from resonator integrator under the effect of an external forcing, although the two behaviors are significantly different. Described in the book Dynamical System in Neuroscience by Eugene M. Izhikevich, as well as in several other experimental articles on the subject, the characteristics of these two types of neurons are clearly established: the so-called "integrator" neuron has an excitability threshold which defines whether the neuron is in activity or not, belongs to class I of excitability (which means that its frequency tends towards 0 during the transition between the stationary and periodic regime), and does not have an subthreshold oscillation. The so-called "resonator" neuron does not have a precise threshold of excitability, belongs to class II of excitability (which means that its frequency does not tend towards 0 during the transition between the stationary and periodic regime), and has subthreshold oscillations.

Based on the studies that have already been carried out on the mathematical analysis of integrator and resonator neurons and on the slow-fast dynamics of systems of differential equations, the aim is therefore to seek to show that an integrator neuron can have the behavior of a resonator neuron, and therefore have oscillations below the precise threshold which normally defines it. Thus, on a non-forced model of integrating neuron, a slow forcing will be imposed in order to reveal a pseudo-collar point and, for well-established parameters, small oscillations of trajectories near it: the model forced will therefore have the behavior of a resonator.
